Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation Corpora
-------------------------------------------------

This organization contains corpora annotated according to the [UCCA scheme](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~oabend/ucca.html).

See the `README.md` file in each repository for more details about each one.

Use the [`split_corpus.py`](https://github.com/huji-nlp/ucca/blob/master/scripts/split_corpus.py) script to split any of the corpora to training, development and testing sets.
